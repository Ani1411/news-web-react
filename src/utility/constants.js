                "content": "Ford, and its executives for that matter, has never been one to shy away from throwing shade at competitors like Tesla. Back in December last year, for example, Ford EV boss Darren Palmer made it a point to state that the Mustang Mach-E would not have the same teething problems that Tesla has faced over the years.  News was abounding then of a Model Y whose glass roof supposedly came off after delivery due to the component not being installed with enough sealant at the Fremont Factory. Seemingly referencing this apparently isolated incident, Palmer noted that such issues would definitely not plague the Mach-E, and that Ford customers would not be required to compromise on build quality. (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); “The doors fit properly, the plastics and other materials color-match, the bumpers don’t fall off, the roof doesn’t come off when you wash it, the door handles don’t get stuck in cold weather,” Palmer said.  In what could only be described as fate loving irony, Ford recently issued two separate recalls in Canada that impacted almost 5,000 Mustang Mach-E units over build quality issues. Transport Canada Recall #2021-561, which was posted on September 15, 2021, concerns the Mach-E’s panoramic glass roof. Approximately 1,812 Mach-Es are affected by the recall. “Issue: On certain vehicles, the glass panel of the panoramic sunroof may not be properly attached. Over time, the glass could become loose and separate from the vehicle. Safety Risk: A glass roof panel that detaches from the vehicle could create a road hazard for others and increase the risk of a crash.” Another recall, #2021-560, impacts about 3,178 units of the popular all-electric crossover, and it concerns the possibility of the vehicle’s windshield detaching while the vehicle is in motion. Similar to the glass roof issue, the Mach-E’s windshield problems also stem from the component not being attached properly. This could cause the vehicle’s windshield to come off. “Issue: On certain vehicles, the windshield may not be properly attached. As a result, the glass can become loose and could separate from the vehicle in a crash. Safety Risk: A windshield that detaches in a crash could create an increased risk of injury.” Ford Mustang Mach-E owners affected by the glass roof and windshield recalls would be notified by the company by mail with instructions on how to address their vehicles’ issues. A Ford dealer would then clean and install additional adhesive to the Mach-E panoramic roof glass, or reinstall the vehicle’s windshield as needed. So far, the Mach-E’s recalls have only been posted only for Canada-based owners. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) does not list the vehicle’s glass roof and windshield recalls yet. Ford, for its part, has opted to remain quite silent about the Mustang Mach-E’s latest recalls.  Don’t hesitate to contact us with account tips. Just send a message to tips@teslarati.com to give us a heads up.  The post Ford mocked Tesla over glass roof “problems” – now the Mach-E is getting recalled for the same issue appeared first on TESLARATI.",

                "content": "As the third quarter comes to a close, Tesla China has practically entered “Plaid Mode” with its operations in Gigafactory Shanghai. Based on recently taken videos of the expansive electric vehicle production plant, it appears that strong efforts are now underway to ensure that Giga Shanghai produces and delivers as many vehicles as possible until the end of the month.  Aerial footage from the Wu Wa channel on YouTube shows that Giga Shanghai is now a hub of activity, with large numbers of Model 3 and Model Y being transported from the factory itself to the facility’s holding lots. Giga Shanghai staff who were transporting vehicles to the holding lots could even be seen stretching their legs as they continued their shifts. #TeslaShanghai Drivers who move their shins between jobs. They will be freed up when Tesla actually achieves autonomous driving into the garage. How long will this take? #ElonMusk pic.twitter.com/PF8kNJoMNj— 乌瓦 (@bentv_sh) September 19, 2021 (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({}); Gigafactory Shanghai’s production and deliveries this September would likely be focused on the local Chinese market. With Giga Shanghai now serving as the company’s primary vehicle export hub, Tesla China has been spending the first months of a quarter producing and transporting vehicles to other territories. The latter half of the quarter is generally allotted for the local market. With this in mind, there is a good chance that Tesla China’s local figures for September would be quite impressive. Even with the company allotting the lion’s share of its production and deliveries to foreign territories in July and August, after all, the Tesla Model 3 and Model Y still sold very well in China. It will then be unsurprising if the Model 3 or Model Y end up becoming one of China’s best-selling EVs for September.  Hi everybody. Here is my Tesla delivery estimate on 13 Sep after China August production data. On 13 Sep, the numbers were as follows: Deliveries in Q3 2021:• My estimate: 229K (up from 225K)• Analyst consensus: 221KI will update this again on 25 Sep and 30 Sep. pic.twitter.com/OPvk7w1Urm— Troy Teslike (@TroyTeslike) September 20, 2021 Back in August, reports emerged stating that Gigafactory Shanghai has managed to achieve a production rate of 1,000 Model Y units per day, formally exceeding the facility’s Model 3 daily output of 800 units. This improvement was achieved after Tesla China temporarily paused Model Y production in Gigafactory Shanghai to make way for upgrades on the facility’s assembly lines. Gigafactory Shanghai is playing a larger part in the company’s operations. Wall Street consensus currently predicts that Tesla would deliver 221,000 vehicles in the third quarter, about half of which would be coming from the China-based factory. Tesla bulls such as @TroyTeslike, on the other hand, estimate that the company could report as many as 229,000 vehicle deliveries for the third quarter, over 120,000 of which would likely be from China.

Those who have been eager to get their hands on one of these VR headsets can now get two at one of the best prices we've seen. Through September 27, Oculus is running a deal that knocks $100 off a second Quest 2 headset when you buy one at full price. That means you can get two of the 128GB models for $500, or two of the 256GB versions for $700.Buy Quest 2 bundle at Oculus - $500Oculus improved its machine in nearly every way with the Quest 2, and the device ultimately earned a score of 89 from us. The headset itself is 10 percent smaller and more comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, although it does take a bit of fiddling to properly adjust its fit for your head. Powered by a Snapdragon XR2 processor, the Quest 2 includes fast-switching LCDs with a resolution of 1832x1920 per eye, and although it didn't launch with this, it will support 90Hz refresh rates. Its controllers are larger than before but still easy to hold, and they include a bit more space next to the gamepad buttons so you can rest your thumbs.The slight design changes and the better processor help make the Quest 2 an improvement on its predecessor in nearly every way. It excels at being both a standalone and a desktop headset, delivering more realistic VR experiences. It does have some limitations when it comes to standalone games, mostly due to its mobile hardware, but that's to be expected. Also, you must sign in with a Facebook account to use the Quest 2, which is also to be expect, but nevertheless a bummer for those who don't use the social network.Follow @EngadgetDeals on Twitter for the latest tech deals and buying advice.",

                "description": "In the age of electric mobility, the trusty bicycle has played a surprisingly low-key role; scooters seem to grab all the headlines (and app rental dollars). Instead, the e-bike has become the preserve of those that can afford one. A decent conventional bike already costs a bit, so adding a motor understandably only adds to that cost. Enter Tenways, a new player in the e-bike world that’s trying to buck that trend. Its debut model, the CGO 600, is currently available on Indiegogo for around $1,400 and despite its relative affordability, it doesn’t scrimp on features.Now, the usual disclaimer: With Indiegogo and other crowdfunding platforms, there’s always an inherent risk. But Tenways states its production is already underway and given that the review model they sent appears to be full and final hardware we were somewhat assured that things are ready to go.The CGO 600 is clearly a city bike with its thinner tires and classic diamond frame. It’s powered by a 250W battery which is discreetly hidden in the downtube, to the point where it’s almost impossible to tell that this bike is electric at all. The rear hub motor is visible, but also small enough to not catch the eye. That motor offers a max assistance speed of 15mph in Europe or 20mph in the US which are the maximum allowed in those territories. The claimed range is around 80 miles per charge (though this seems optimistic) and it’s all bundled into a package that weighs around 15 kilograms (around 33 pounds).James Trew / EngadgetBeyond the key specs, the motor uses a torque sensor for fast, smooth acceleration with three levels of assistance. The bike has no gears, so the motor acts as either regular assist or can be used like gears when going uphill. The brakes are hydraulic for easier maintenance and the carbon belt transmission should mean no oily fingers or pit stops to set it back in place. The CGO 600 can be fully charged in about 2.5 hours, and there’s a small LCD display that acts as an onboard trip computer and power button.I won’t lie, the specs were pretty impressive at this price point, but what initially drew me to the CGO 600 was the understated design. While it looks great in all the five colorways, there’s something about the black and green model that looks stealthy. The fact that it doesn’t scream “e-bike” makes it feel less of a lure for thieves and just all round makes for an attractive object. In many ways it reminds me of the Cowboy (€1,990 or roughly $2,198) but with a little less aggressively modern design.Your first task will be putting the bike together, but it’s not too much of a challenge and I was all set and done in less than an hour with a tea break and work interruptions along the way. Once you have it together, you can download the companion app if you wish (it’s not essential unlike on the Cowboy) and get out there on the road.There are two frame sizes on offer are 50cm (19 inch) and 54cm (21 inch) with no step-through option if that’s your preference or if the available sizes are too big for you. I’m a fairly average height and find the 50cm version I tested to be comfortable. The riding position is a little forward-leaning, but not in a way that bothered me.James Trew / EngadgetThe very first thing you’ll notice is both how fast to engage and how smooth the motor is. When at a standstill at stoplights, it only takes a fraction of a second for the assistance to kick in. It’s smooth enough that it’s not jarring but powerful enough for you to instantly feel the benefit. Once you’re up to speed, it sometimes feels like the assistance isn’t really helping as much, but you only have to turn it off and have the bike in manual mode for a few seconds before your thighs remind you you’re running on your own steam.It’s when you’re going uphill that you’ll really feel the benefit. The torque sensor means that the amount of assistance immediately responds to the intensity of the ascent. I found that even on fairly steep inclines I didn’t need to get up off the saddle; just fire up the highest level of power and work the pedals.The torque sensor is also magnetic rather than pressure-based, meaning you can happily ride the CGO 600 entirely on your own leg power without any resistance or burden from the motor. This is great if you’re worried about it being less useful if the battery runs out.About that: Tenways’ claim of 80 miles of assistance per charge is hard to gauge. I certainly haven’t ridden 80 miles on it yet. But on one full charge I’ve covered just over 22 with 58-percent battery remaining. On a crude calculation, that means I am on track for about 45/50 miles on a single charge. That’s much less than the advertised 80, but I also really enjoy the full power assist, so if you only rode on level one, you’d likely eke more miles out of it. Either way, 50 miles or so would cover a 5-mile commute back and forth over a week without charging.It’s worth mentioning that there’s no throttle mode here. That’s fairly typical of e-bikes in this style, but in case you were hoping for it, now you know. That said, if you press and hold the down button on the odometer, the bike will creep along on its motor, but it’s only about three miles an hour, so more of a gentle start or a lane splitter’s tool than anything like a motorbike mode.James Trew / EngadgetIn keeping with the stealthy looks, that motor makes nary a sound. It’s not entirely silent, but certainly you’re not going to hear it while riding around town. I love that the hub motor is barely visible and that the battery is so well hidden. Though, of course, that does mean there’s no option to buy spares/swap them out. But it also means you can breeze past serious cyclists on their racers while barely breaking a sweat and enjoy their curious glances as you do so.One last comment on how it rides: It’s definitely not an off-road bike. That is fairly obvious from the design, but worth mentioning. The CGO 600 lives for asphalt. I took it over some less friendly terrains (potholes, gravel and a decked pathway) and while it handled it all fine, the suspension is pretty hard so you’ll feel every teeth-clattering bump.The onboard computer is useful but simple. The default screen has everything you need to know at a glance (speed/battery/distance etc.). Then there are sub-screens that are accessible with a tap for more detailed information like average speed and range. This is also where you can add some security via a passcode for the motor. This obviously doesn’t prevent someone stealing your bike, but it’s a small deterrent perhaps?James Trew / EngadgetAt only 15kg, the CGO 600 is definitely one of the lighter e-bikes in this style. Lighter than both the Cowboy (16kg) and the VanMoof Electrified S2 (19kg, $2,298). This makes it a more manageable option if you need to lug it up stairs or, like me, man-handle it into an elevator each time you want to head out. It also makes manual mode a little easier on the legs should you prefer to go on human power (or if the battery runs out).On a more practical note, Tenways included an integrated front light that's bright enough for those darker sections of your nighttime city commute. How it fares in more rural settings is likely a different matter. There’s also a rear light included, but it’s an accessory you attach with its own battery, so something you’ll need to check regularly if you don’t want to get caught out.The humble city e-bike has evolved greatly in the last few years, but still needs a little push to bring it into the mainstream as a viable commuting option. Companies like Cowboy, VanMoof and Brompton have been chipping away at the remaining resistance points and now Tenways is here to show you can take most of the features from those models and package them in a more pocket-friendly way. The $1,400 price will likely go up once the Indiegogo campaign ends, but expect it to remain competitive even at retail prices.",

Deadline is reporting that the role will be recast with The Witcher's Dónal Finn taking up the dice.Season Two already began production and filming, with the reason behind the recast still unclear or announced. The long-awaited adapted series from Robert Jordan's books was renewed before the first season hit the streaming platform back in May, with the first season premiering November 19.Even in the first trailer, we see Harris as Mat picks up a bejeweled dagger from the forbidden land of Shadar Logoth. It's still uncertain how much of the first season will cover what with showrunner Rafe Judkins saying that \"Season 1 will cover Book One, plus some of Book Two and even Book Three. But also not all of Book One, as some of it is in Season 2.\"The Wheel of Time follows Moiraine (Rosamund Pike), a wielder of the mysterious One Power called an Aes Sedai. She arrives in the small town of Two Rivers and from there, embarks on a dangerous journey with young men and women, one of whom is predicted to destroy the world.",

                "description": "Seth MacFarlane has revealed a new Family Guy-themed COVID-19 vaccine PSA featuring Stewie and Brian encouraging people to get the vaccine. In the clip, which debuted on Jimmy Kimmel's late night show, Stewie runs through the reasons why it's important to follow CDC guidance and take the vaccine.\"The common side effects from the COVID vaccines are generally mild and last a few days. But do you know what can have serious long-term side effects? COVID,\" Stewie says to Brian, who is playing the skeptic in the video.Then Brian asks Stewie about what people could say to a person--namely, Peter--who doesn't feel the need to get the vaccine if everyone else around them does.\"Getting the shot not only protects him but also the people around him. But even more importantly, if the virus is allowed to spread through an unvaccinated population, it could mutate into a variant that the vaccine might not protect against,\" Stewie says, as the shot cuts to Meg depicted as a horrible virus. \"And then we're right back to where we started: Gal Gadot singing 'Imagine.' We cannot let that happen!\"This is not the first Family Guy vaccine PSA, as the show ran a PSA of sorts in April featuring Stewie performing the \"Mom, Mum, Momma\" scene from the Season 5 episode remixed with Stewie shouting \"get the vaccine\" when Lois finally answers him. Before that, there was a fake podcast with Stewie and Brian talking about COVID in general.",

                "description": "After several extremely successful collaborations, Zee TV and Balaji Telefilms have recently launched an exciting show about life, love, karma, and destiny. Set against the backdrop of Mumbai, Bhagya Lakshmi follows the journey of Lakshmi, a selfless girl of limited means, who despite her humble background and the curveballs life has thrown at her, always puts others’ needs before hers. The show has already impressed the audience with its intriguing storyline and relatable characters. However, looks like the audience is in for some high-octane drama with the mega revelation about Rishi’s actual love interest - Mallishka, which is played by the popular actress Maera Misshra. Maera is seen essaying the role of Mallishka Singh Bedi, who is the daughter of a big magazine publisher. In the earlier episodes, everyone thought that she is just Rishi’s friend, but it is now time for the big revelation, Mallishka is actually the one Rishi loves. However, Mallishka is very self-centered and likes to keep Rishi in her control. She makes him do anything she likes, according to her whims and fancies. Mallishka’s possessiveness is also something to watch out for as she will do anything to get him. With the truth coming out, many secrets of the Oberoi family will also start spilling out. Talking about her character, Maera mentioned, \"When I was offered a role in Bhagya Lakshmi, I was very excited, especially because it is a Balaji show that airs on Zee TV. It was actually one of the most out-of-the-blue calls that I’ve got in my entire life, as I was packing my bags to come to Mumbai for something else when I got a call from the Bhagya Lakshmi team, saying I was selected for this crucial role. After Guddan Tumse Na Ho Payega, this is my second show with Zee TV, and I am excited to play a grey character. I feel grey characters give me a great opportunity to explore and enhance my acting skills. In fact, even the audience doesn't care about someone playing a negative character or a positive character anymore. They don’t typecast anyone anymore and they want to see what the actor brings to the show. That enables me to show my talent in any role and I am really eager to showcase my acting prowess through the character of Mallishka. To be honest, I am nothing like Mallishka, so it is a challenge in itself. I hope everyone supports me and showers me with love and blessings like always.\" Talking about her co-stars, Maera adds, \"They are absolutely amazing. I remember the first day of my shoot, they all welcomed me very warmly. I already knew Rohit and Aishwarya is such a sweet girl, we all bonded very well on the first day itself. Working with Smita Ji, Uday Ji and the production team has been a wonderful experience as well, everyone is so warm and nice that I don't feel like I am away from home while I am on set.\" With the revelation of the other woman in Rishi’s life coming to the fore, what will Lakshmi do?

                "description": "Kangana Ranaut is a proactive observer of the Bollywood industry and has been always vocal about her opinions. Recently, she took a dig again at Alia Bhatt who has landed herself into controversy for her latest bridal advertisement. The advertisement has landed into controversy and is getting slammed by the people as it questioned the tradition of Kanyadaan a Hindu tradition in which the bride’s parents give away their daughter to the groom. Taking a dig at this Kangana took to her Instagram and wrote a lengthy post saying that women are worshipped in the scriptures and there’s no harm in seeing them as ‘precious source of existence’. Kangana wrote, \"We often see a martyr’s father on television, when they lose a son on the border, they roar ‘Don’t worry, I have one more son, uska bhi daan main iss dharti Maa ko dunga. Kanyadan ho ya putradan, the way society looks at the concept of renunciation shows its core value system…” She added, \"The way a society looks at the concept of (lack of equivalent word in English or Urdu using) renunciation shows it's core value system... When they start to look down upon the very idea of daan... Then you know it is time for reestablishment of Ram Rajya... The King who renounced everything he loved only to live the life of Tapasvi (Monk) Please stop mocking Hindus and their rituals.\" In the end, she concluded and wrote, \"Dharti and Woman both are mothers in scriptures they are worshipped as goddess of fertility...Nothing wrong in seeing them as precious and very source of existence (shakti).\"   View this post on Instagram   A post shared by Kangana Thalaivii (@kanganaranaut) Sharing the post she appealed to the brands and wrote a caption that reads \"Humble request to all brands ….. don’t use religion, minority, majority politics to sell things …. Stop manipulating naive consumer with shrewd divisive concepts and advertising…\" ALSO READ:‘Have lost faith in this Court’: Kangana Ranaut files a counter defamation case against Javed Akhtar after appearing in Court",
